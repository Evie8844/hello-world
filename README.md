Trial run + ideas

Hi!

I have always wanted to learn how to program and code. Because of my job I now have a chance  to do that and I am so grateful <3 
But quite honestly I'm also using this to distract myself from seeing the awfulness of our world...I still can't believe what is happening...not just in USA, but at home as well. So I need a distraction as to not feel so crappy all the time because I can't help in a constructive way...

Ever the optimist,
